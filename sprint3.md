Sprint 3 Tasks (Week 10)


1. Build the Calendar UI
Choose either:
Monthly calendar
Or weekly calendar 
My calendar will:
Display days in a grid or horizontal scroll
Highlight the current day
Show dots or icons on days with routines



2. Connect Routines to Calendar Days

Which routines include each day
For example, if a routine has ["Mon", "Wed"], show an indicator on those days
Organize routines by day of the week
This allows the calendar to reflect the correct schedule.

3. Tap a Day → Show Daily Routine
When the user taps a day:
Navigate to a “DailyDetailView”
Display all skincare items assigned to that day
Split into:
Morning
Evening
Example layout:
Monday, Feb 12
-----------------
Morning:
• Cleanser
• Vitamin C

Evening:
• Retinol
• Moisturizer


4. Auto-Update Calendar When Routines Change
If a routine is added, edited, or deleted:
Calendar should refresh
Day indicators should update
This ensures the routines stay synced across screens.

5. Light UI Styling
Add simple visuals to make the calendar readable:
Selected day highlighted
Today highlighted differently
Use soft aesthetic colors (optional now, mandatory in final polish)


6. Navigation Flow
Make sure users can navigate:
Calendar → Daily Detail → Edit Routine
Daily Detail → Back to Calendar
Calendar → Home (tab or back button)
